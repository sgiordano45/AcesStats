[{"date":"9/28/2025","home team":"Silver","away team":"Black","home odds":"400","away odds":"-300","preview":"Betting on Aces Black seems like easy money after their first ever defeat of Aces Blue behind Casey LaCasse's stellar pitching. Meanwhile, Silver is still searching for their first triumph after managing just 1 run against expansion Aces White last week. This league has a funny way of bucking trends quickly though, and a 8 AM start could factor to someone's advantage or detriment. Regardless, Silver may need a 3 for 3 with 6 total bases and a BB performance from The Kid Murowski to have a chance against a stoic Black defense. Props to Black's Matt Wasserman for hitting .750 with an on-base percentage of .777 in the early going.","time":"8:00 AM"},{"date":"9/28/2025","home team":"Green","away team":"Red","home odds":"-250","away odds":"350","preview":"This 9 AM tilt features a battle of backup pitchers as longtime buddies Dennis McCabe and Matt DeAnna will not be on Senior Field for Sunday. I'd say Aces Red is off to a chilly start with their bats, yet their fall average is actually an improvement from its summer numbers - it's their run prevention in critical moments that's been the issue in two losses. Green has used a soft schedule to log 3 blowout victories (the same number as all of the other Aces teams combined) with a mesmerizing 55 runs across the plate. Can Red break out of their mini slump to force Green to play meaningful softball past the 3rd inning? Red gave Green all they could handle in the 2024 fall postseason (1-1), but their regular season success at Deerfield versus the back-to-back champs has been nonexistent.","time":"9:00 AM"},{"date":"9/28/2025","home team":"White","away team":"Orange","home odds":"500","away odds":"-400","preview":"After an impressive opener, Orange has slumped to a 2-game losing streak against notables Blue and Carolina. I'm not too concerned as they didn't have some key members in a 10-3 defeat at the hands of Blue, and Aces Carolina is really stacked from a talent perspective and may even be flying under the radar with some of you. Aces White impressively picked up their first win from a pitcher's duel where Ralph Pombo - formerly of Aces Black - kept Silver's top half of the lineup at bay. I don't see a White winning streak in their future if Orange has most of their players, but guys like Silverman (.500) and Desiderio (.556) should have the league on notice.","time":"10:00 AM"},{"date":"9/28/2025","home team":"Purple","away team":"Gold","home odds":"350","away odds":"-250","preview":"The final game on Sunday morning completes a slate where each game possesses a moderate to heavy favorite. Aces Gold may have edged Red after a blown rules interpretation in the bottom of the 7th, but I have to give credit where credit is due - Gold was without Chase, Treyman and Kirch and still pulled out a key victory. Now, the 2-0 squad sets their sights on Aces Purple, a team that's done its fair share of hitting (.520) yet are giving up an average of 13 runs per contest. That runs against mark negatively correlates with success, but asking Purple to hold a deep Gold lineup at bay on Sunday could be a tall task.","time":"11:00 AM"},{"date":"10/3/2025","home team":"Blue","away team":"Carolina","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":"9:00 PM"},{"date":"10/5/2025","home team":"Purple","away team":"White","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/5/2025","home team":"Black","away team":"Blue","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/5/2025","home team":"Carolina","away team":"Silver","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/5/2025","home team":"Green","away team":"Gold","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/5/2025","home team":"Orange","away team":"Red","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/9/2025","home team":"Black","away team":"Gold","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/9/2025","home team":"Gold","away team":"Black","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/12/2025","home team":"Gold","away team":"Green","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/12/2025","home team":"Purple","away team":"Carolina","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/12/2025","home team":"Orange","away team":"Silver","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/12/2025","home team":"Red","away team":"Black","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/12/2025","home team":"White","away team":"Blue","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/19/2025","home team":"Black","away team":"Purple","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/19/2025","home team":"Silver","away team":"Gold","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/19/2025","home team":"Orange","away team":"Green","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/19/2025","home team":"White","away team":"Carolina","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/19/2025","home team":"Red","away team":"Blue","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/26/2025","home team":"Gold","away team":"Orange","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/26/2025","home team":"Red","away team":"White","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/26/2025","home team":"Green","away team":"Black","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/26/2025","home team":"Silver","away team":"Carolina","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"10/26/2025","home team":"Purple","away team":"Blue","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/2/2025","home team":"Black","away team":"White","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/2/2025","home team":"Purple","away team":"Orange","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/2/2025","home team":"Blue","away team":"Gold","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/2/2025","home team":"Carolina","away team":"Green","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/2/2025","home team":"Silver","away team":"Red","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/6/2025","home team":"Carolina","away team":"Gold","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/6/2025","home team":"White","away team":"Red","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/7/2025","home team":"Silver","away team":"Purple","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/7/2025","home team":"Black","away team":"Orange","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/9/2025","home team":"Black","away team":"Green","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/9/2025","home team":"Red","away team":"Carolina","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/9/2025","home team":"Blue","away team":"Silver","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/9/2025","home team":"Gold","away team":"White","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/9/2025","home team":"Orange","away team":"Purple","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/13/2025","home team":"Red","away team":"Purple","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/13/2025","home team":"Green","away team":"Silver","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/13/2025","home team":"Blue","away team":"Orange","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/14/2025","home team":"Blue","away team":"Green","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""},{"date":"11/14/2025","home team":"Carolina","away team":"White","home odds":"","away odds":"","preview":"","time":""}]
